This solution brings together previous assignments and material from 3500. It uses the updated version
of SpreadsheetUtilities from PS2 and the updated version of Formula from PS3. Both dll's as well as xml
files can be found under Resources - Libraries. This is the improved version of PS4 and is considered PS5

In order to make my code simplier, cleaner, and to use abstraction I created a private class inside of spreadsheet
that creates a cell object. This idea was mentioned by another student in class and it seemed like a good
idea. Hopefully this does not go against assignment specifications but it allows each cell to keep track 
of its own contents and name. This way the rest of my code isn't as messy.

I was able to get the XML writing and saving to work correctly, however, formula errors still seem to be a problem for my code. 
I think it may have something to do with not having a lookup thing for my cell.
